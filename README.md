# Project: Interpretative analysis of human somatic mutations in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Leveraging feature selection and AI for enhanced diagnostic precision_comments

## Introduction
This project is separated in two sections:
The first section provides insights into the biological mechanisms underlying observed phenotypic differences, evolutionary dynamics, and potential functional consequences of genetic variations.
the second section includes the classification of cancer types based on machine learning and deep learning.
